1. Heroku login
2. Git bash
3. Heroku cli
Complete the above three things

Make sure to have following files/folders inside the project folder:
1. app.py
2. requirements.txt
3. Procfile
4. static folder
5. templates folder

Further steps:

1. Now open git bash
2. Make your project folder as the working directory using cd commands.
3. Initialise a git folder in the project folder using-
    'git init'
    Above will clear some git folders in the project folder
    But they will be hidden. To see check the view hidden files option
    Till now we have initialised git. But it does not know anything about our project
4. Use 'git status' to track what files does git know for now
5. git add .
    . means all the files of the folder.
6. Now save the changes as version-1

    git commit -m "initial commit"

    -m is for any msg
    and we can give any msg.

7. heroku create (if it is not working - use 'heroku login' in cmd)
    it will create a blank application for us into our heroku account over web. We can go there and check it too.
8. git remote -v
9. git push heroku master
