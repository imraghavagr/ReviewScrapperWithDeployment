We write Procfile for cloud deployment

We can have many .py files in our project directory
so when we will deploy it on web, we need to specify that
which file to run.
For this purpose we create a Procfile in the project folder
this file does not have any extensions
gunicorn - a library

app:app
first 'app' is the file name which we want to be executed
Second 'app' is the object of the flask class that we have instantiated in our app.py file

just write the following line in Procfile

web: gunicorn app:app
